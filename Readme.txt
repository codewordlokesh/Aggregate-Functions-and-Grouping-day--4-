# Task 4 - Aggregate Functions and Grouping

This task demonstrates the use of SQL **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) along with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

## Files
- **schema.sql** → Contains table creation (`employees`) and sample data.
- **aggregate.sql** → Contains queries using aggregate functions and grouping.

## Queries Implemented
1. SUM - Total salary of employees
2. AVG - Average salary by department
3. COUNT - Employees in each department
4. GROUP BY with HAVING - Departments with more than 2 employees
5. MAX - Highest salary in each department
6. MIN - Lowest salary in each department
7. ROUND - Rounded average salary
8. COUNT DISTINCT - Count unique departments
9. HAVING with SUM - Departments with salary > 150000
10. GROUP BY YEAR - Employees hired each year

## How to Run
1. Run `schema.sql` in MySQL Workbench or SQLite.
2. Then execute `aggregate.sql` to see results.
